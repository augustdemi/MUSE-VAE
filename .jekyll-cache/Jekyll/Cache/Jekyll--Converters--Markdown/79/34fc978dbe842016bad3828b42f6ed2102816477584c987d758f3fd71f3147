  <li>Path Finding Simulation Dataset was generated by simulating the navigation of agents within 100 large synthetic environments.
These environments were designed according to the external shapes and interior organizations of rooms and corridors generally found in contemporary architecture.
Unlike SDD and nuScenes, the non-navigable spaces in these environments are significantly more complex for navigation.
Each of the environments was used to simulate 500 scenes (amounting to 50,000 total scenes), where a single agent navigates between two random points within the environment using the prevalent Social Force model.</li>
